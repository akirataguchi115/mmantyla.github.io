group</a> (2nd session)</p>

<p><a href="Experiment_instructions_accurate_2_web.pdf">Instructions handed for 
the non time pressure group</a> (2nd session)</p>
<p><a href="Experiment_data_form_OWS_B_2_web.pdf">Sheets were test-cases were 
written and defects were marked</a> (2nd session)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.soberit.hut.fi/mmantyla/Survey_Form_1a.pdf">The survey

<p>The only difference to the 1st session material is that the system mentioned 
was Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) not Online Web Shop (OWS)</p>
<p>Note: The requirements documents are not available as we do not want them to
